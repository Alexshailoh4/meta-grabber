## Instructions
Rename your files with these steps:

1. **Search for your TV show.**  
   Just begin typing the name of the show, the autocomplete will suggest results from the `themoviedb.org` API.
   
1. **Choose all the files you want to rename.**  
   The files can also be located in different directories.
   
1. **Select seasons/episodes of the TV show.**  
   You have to select, which seasons or episodes of the show you are looking for. You can toggle listed seasons/episodes by clicking them.
   
1. **(optional) Select your output directory.**  
   You can move your files to a different directory as well. If you leave this empty, all the files will remain, where they are and just change its name.
